# Code-Cracker

These are some short programs that I wrote for Computer Security to assist me in solving some of the problems. There are a number
of parts to the program, one uses the Caeser Cypher to code and decode messages, that is my shifting the letters to the left
or to the right.

The second uses the double transposition cypher, while the third involves frequency analysis, namely by analysing the number of
times a specific character appears in the text, and then comparing it with the frequency of letters in a given alphabet. The
program also allows you to switch letters around.
